Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) refer to a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. They are also known as heart diseases and include coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and heart valve problems, among others.

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of CVD and occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. This can cause chest pain, also known as angina, or a heart attack if a blood clot forms and blocks the artery.

Heart failure occurs when the heart cannot pump blood effectively, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and other organs. Arrhythmias refer to abnormal heart rhythms that can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. Heart valve problems can occur when the valves that control blood flow in and out of the heart do not work properly.

CVDs can be caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Prevention and management of CVDs involve lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a healthy diet, smoking cessation, and medication management of underlying conditions.

Early detection and treatment of CVDs are essential to prevent complications and improve outcomes. Symptoms of CVDs may include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling in the legs, and irregular heartbeats. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention promptly.
